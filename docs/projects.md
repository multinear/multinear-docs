## What is a project

A project is a collection of [key components](intro.md#key-components). Each component has an info card, as well as a link to the relevant source - GitHub repo, etc. Projects have revisions too. Each revision can have benchmarks.

## Benchmarks

A benchmark is a set of task evaluations. It is used to evaluate the performance of the code on a given set of tasks, with a given dataset, using evaluation methods provided.

Our platform is built for experimentation and benchmarking. It is agnostic to the AI frameworks used. You can use anything: LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom code. 

What's important is tracking down the exact versions of the key components, and resulting benchmarks. That will allow you (or other people in your team) to compare and reproduce the results.

## Collaboration

Multinear is built for collaboration. Think of it as GitHub for AI projects. Each project needs benchmarks. Each benchmark depends on data, tasks, evals, code, config. Review other people's projects, discuss with others, fork projects for your own use, contribute an improved version.
